[^1]: Only 13 hosts are proposed when we don't use an account.

[^3]: File size is not restricted by the software, but by the host. It all depends on the host's capacity.
[^4]: History is only available to registered users.
[^5]: Offline hosts are not deactivated, we need to go to "https://www.mirrored.to/p/host-status" for status information.
