# Presentation

This project lets you upload your files remotely to different hosting sites.

## Quick description

Currently, my application supports **51 hosting sites**.

So you can uplod your files remotely and get the download link created. You can upload from local storage or from a URL. You can also upload your file to multiple hosts simultaneously and retrieve all the links created.

I've provided predefined profiles to simplify things, but if you like, you can create your own profiles with your chosen hosts. Rename them, change hosts and, if necessary, delete them.

You have access to a history of links created, showing its upload date and the time remaining before it expires. When your file has expired, this is indicated. You can easily clear the history.

Every day, a check is made to see if the hosts are still online. If this is not the case, the script makes it unavailable.

You can manually delete the file uploaded to the host from the history, provided that the host is able to delete it and offers the ability to do so. You'll find a list below.
